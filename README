php_abb is a ftplugin for php, mostly providing insert mode abbreviations
for php builtin functions and control structures.  These abbreviations
expand to function stubs and should help you remember the syntax in
addition to speeding typing.  A map-like function that does a number of
possibly obtuse things is also included.

The insert mode abbreviations come in two falvors: those using the raw
php function name (these can be disabled) and those prefixed with g:phpLeader.  
See the help file for details.

The phpActOnVariable function performs a number of activities on the php
variable under your cursor at the time the function is executed.  You should
create a map to this function.  As an example of how you would use this, say you
have mapped it to <leader>m and you have your cursor on any letter in the word
test in the following code:

     $test = "FooBaR";

If you then type <leader>m and strtl<cr> a new line will be opened underneath
and the following code will be inserted:

     $test = strtolower($test);

You can see a list of all the mappings for this function by executing the
function and entering '?' when prompted.
